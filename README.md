# HEP Dash

Designed to take ROOT TTrees and build interactive web-browser-based notebooks.

Possibly use streamlit, dash more advanced?

Think about functionality and optimal use case...

Most up-to-date functionality so far is the `make_premade_comparison_app.py` function. `make_general_comparison_app.py` has also been created.


For effective README exhibiting features of the app, use this site to create screen recordings: https://gifcap.dev/
